# Pathfinding project in Unity

This project is an exploration of pathfinding algorithms in Unity. The game is a simulation of multiple agents moving around a map, trying to reach their destination. The agents are controlled by the A* algorithm, which is implemented in C#. The agents are opposed by chairs running their own pathfinding algorithm. The chairs are controlled by a simple algorithm that tries to move towards the player.

## Analysis of the pathfinding algorithms

I ran a performance analysis of the algorithms by measuring FPS data while the game was running. The results are discussed in the [report](./report/pathfinding.md)
